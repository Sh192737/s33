Electrical Engineering

As an electrical engineering student, I have been exploring various aspects of robotics. This report focuses on three key areas: writing algorithms for servo motors, building circuits with servo motors, and designing code for circuits using the ESP32 with sensors.

## Writing Algorithm for Servo Motors
To simulate a robot's walking motion, I developed an algorithm to control servo motors. This involved:

- **Understanding Servo Mechanics**: Learning how servo motors allow precise control of angular positions, which is essential for mimicking walking movements.
- **Algorithm Development**: Creating an algorithm that calculates the necessary angles and timing for each servo motor to coordinate their movements effectively.

## Building a Circuit with 6 Servo Motors
Next, I focused on creating a circuit containing six servo motors in a simulator. This process included:

- **Circuit Design**: Designing a schematic to connect the servo motors to a microcontroller.
- **Simulation**: Utilizing simulation software to visualize and test the circuit, ensuring its functionality before physical implementation.

## Designing and Writing Code for ESP32 with Sensors
The final aspect of my project involved writing code for a circuit that includes an ESP32 microcontroller and various sensors. This included:

- **ESP32 Overview**: Understanding the capabilities of the ESP32, which features built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, making it suitable for IoT applications.
- **Sensor Integration**: Coding to integrate sensors, such as ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement, to enhance the robot's functionality.
- **Programming**: Writing code to process sensor data and control the servo motors accordingly, allowing the robot to interact with its environment.

Through this project, I have gained valuable insights into the integration of algorithms, circuit design, and programming in electrical engineering. The experience of developing a robotic walking mechanism using servo motors and sensors has deepened my understanding of the interplay between hardware and software in modern engineering.
